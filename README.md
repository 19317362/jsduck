JsDuck aims to be a better documentation generator for [Ext JS][] than
the old [ext-doc][] was. It is used by Sencha to document [Ext JS
4][ext4-docs], [Sencha Touch][touch] and [several other][other-docs]
products.

The highlights of JSDuck are [Markdown][] support and keeping you DRY
by inferring a lot of information from code.  Read the [Guide][] for
full overview.

Getting it
----------

Standard rubygems install should do:

    $ [sudo] gem install jsduck

If you encounter errors during gem installation, you may need to
install the header files for compiling extension modules for ruby 1.8.
For Debian systems you'll need the `ruby1.8-dev` package.  For Red Hat
/ CentOS / Fedora use the `ruby-devel` package.

For **Windows** users out there, you can download the binary version,
which includes Ruby interpreter and all dependencies bundled in a
single .exe file.  Grab it from the [download page][].

Usage
-----

For the simplest test-run just use the `--builtin-classes` option to
automatically produce documentation for JavaScript builtin classes
like Array, String and Object:

    $ jsduck --builtin-classes --output your/docs

You can also use `--verbose` option to see what's actually happening.

To generate docs for Ext JS 4 add path to the corresponding src/ dir:

    $ jsduck ext-4.0.7/src \
             --builtin-classes \
             --images ext-4.0.7/docs/images \
             --output your/docs

The `--images` option specifies a path for images included with
`{@img}` tags inside the source code.

To generate docs for your own project, simply name additional input
directories:

    $ jsduck ext-4.0.7/src project1/js project2/js ...

Note that the resulting documentation will only contain the API
documentation.  Guides, videos and examples will not be present.
These can be added using more command line options as explained in the
[Advanced Usage][adv] section of wiki.

Running JSDuck against older Ext JS than 4.0.7 is expected to generate
a lot of warnings.  Similarly your own .js files will probably
generate warnings too.  Sorry for that, JSDuck just wants to be
helpful.  If you are overwhelmed by the warnings, you can disable them
using `--no-warnings` switch.  Another thing that often happens is
that JSDuck is unable to determine into which class a member belongs
and will place all such items into a global class - you can disable
this using the `--ignore-global` switch.  For full list of command
line options type `jsduck --help=full`.
